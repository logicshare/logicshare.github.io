## Introduction

When buying a car, one of the most important factors one must assess about the car's performance is its mileage measured in Miles/(US) gallon (MPG).
The major component of the running cost is the skyrocketing fuel prices and one has to be diligent when deciding which car to buy to get your moneys worth.

## Why mpgapp?

This app predicts a car's MPG based on the inputs of Gross Horsepower, Weight and Transmission type of the car.
User can adjust the inputs in such a way that the desired predicted MPG is achieved.
